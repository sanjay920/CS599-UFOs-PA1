Learnt to use D3 for interactive visualizations.
We explored various visualization technique and used Dendrograms, Dynamic Circle Packing, USA Maps, d3-geo.

D3 maps helped us to analyze the overlap between UFO sightings dataset and various features we added to the dataset.
Ploting th elocation of points of different UFO sightings, airports, metro cities, etc helped us validate the veracity
of UFO sightings.

Dendrograms, circle packing in D3 heped us effectively visualize the clustered data to analyze how different rows in the 
dataset are similar or dissimilar to each other.

We thought of some simpler and more clear visualization of clusters, which led us to indented tree visualization. This is 
much cleaner and readable compared to circle packing. So, we made a pull request to tika-similarity so that it sould be 
extended in the same.
