This dataset has sightings across the world. In order to limit it to the ones scene in US.

A) Run "" for to find only US related meteorite landings.

1) From the geo locations of meteorite sightings, find the ones which are within the bounding box for US states.
2) Save this as "us_metorite_landings_with_states.csv"

B) Run "merge_meteorite.py" for merging meteorite sightings with ufo sightings.

Here's a brief overview of the process.

Assumptions : As we just have the year and nothing more. Merging the ufo data and metorite data only on the year.
 1 - For each entry in the ufo data set, get the state and the sighted at year.
 2 - Filter the metorite data set by year first and then by state. There by limitiing the number of comparisions
 4 - Compute the distance from the metorite landing and record the observations
 5 - Append all the findings to the data frame and save it as a dataframe
