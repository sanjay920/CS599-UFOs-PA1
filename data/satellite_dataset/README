This dataset has sightings across the world. In order to limit it to the ones scene in US.

A) Run "" for to find only US related Satellite launches.

1) From the geo locations of satellite launch sites, find the ones which are within the bounding box for US states.
2) Save this as "USC_Satellite_Dataset.csv"

B) Run "merge_satellite.py" for merging meteorite sightings with ufo sightings.

Here's a brief overview of the process.

Assumptions : As we can just merge on year and day, merge the ufo data and satellite data only on year and day.
 1 - For each entry in the ufo data set, get the state day and year.
 2 - Filter the metorite data set by year first and then by state. There by limitiing the number of comparisions
 3 - Filter the metorite data set by day first and then by state. There by limitiing the number of comparisions
 4 - Compute the distance from the satellite launch site and record the observations
 5 - Append all the findings to the data frame and save it as a dataframe
